/*
Things to do with the 0.0.1 version of CWRL
    1. Create a game board
    2. No objects should be on the game board initially
    3. A game board can have objects added to it
    4. Game board tracks the position of those objects
    5. Objects are moved by updating the object on the gameboard

When I start the game a gameboard is initialized with a width and height
